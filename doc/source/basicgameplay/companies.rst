Companies
=========
When exploring the :ref:`world <gameplay_world>`, you can visit various companies. At
these companies, you can apply for jobs.

Working a job lets you earn money, experience, and reputation with that company.

While working for a company, you can click "Do something else simultaneously" to be able 
to do things while you continue to work in the background. There is a 20% penalty to the 
related gains. Clicking the "Focus" button under the overview will return you to the 
current work.   

If you've been hired to do a job you can click that "Apply for X Job" button again to get a 
promotion if you meet the requirements. You can see the requirements by hovering your cursor 
over the button. Higher positions give increased rewards.
