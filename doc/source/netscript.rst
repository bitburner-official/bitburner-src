Netscript
=========
Netscript is the programming language used in the world of Bitburner.

When you write scripts in Bitburner, they are written in the Netscript language.
Netscript is simply a subset of `JavaScript <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript>`_.
This means that Netscript's syntax is
identical to that of JavaScript, but it does not implement some of the features
that JavaScript has.
