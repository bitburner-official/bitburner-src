Netscript 1.0
=============

.. note:: Note that NS1/.script is being deprecated, avoid using and migrate
        scripts to NS2/.js if possible.

Netscript 1.0 is implemented using a modified version of Neil Fraser's
`JS-Interpreter <https://github.com/NeilFraser/JS-Interpreter>`_.

This is an ES5 JavaScript interpreter. This means that (almost) any JavaScript feature
that is available in ES5 is also available in Netscript 1.0. However, this also means
that the interpreter does not natively support any JavaScript features introduced in versions
ES6 or after.

If you are confused by the ES5/ES6/etc. terminology, consider reading this:
`WTF is ES6, ES8, ES2017, ECMAScript... <https://codeburst.io/javascript-wtf-is-es6-es8-es-2017-ecmascript-dca859e4821c>`_

Netscript 1.0 scripts end with the ".script" extension in their filenames.

Which ES6+ features are supported?

above are supported as well.
