# PR title

Formatted as such:
CATEGORY: Change Description

CATEGORY is something like "API", "UI", "MISC", "STANEK", etc, and must be uppercase.
Change Description is what you'd tell a non-contributor to convey what is changed.

# Linked issues

If your pull request is related to a git issue, please link it in the description using #xyz.
If your PR should close the issue when it is merged in, use `fixes #xyz` or `closes #xyz` like this:

closes #xxxx
closes #yyyy

It'll automate the process.

- Include screenshot / gif (if possible)

Make sure you run `npm run format` and `npm run lint` before pushing.
