## NS.share() method

Share the server's ram with your factions.

**Signature:**

```typescript
share(): Promise<void>;
```
**Returns:**

Promise&lt;void&gt;

## Remarks

RAM cost: 2.4 GB

Increases rep/second for all faction work while share is running. Each cycle of ns.share() is 10 seconds. Scales with thread count, but at a sharply decreasing rate.
