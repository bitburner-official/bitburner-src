## HackingFormulas.growAmount() method

Calculate the amount of money a grow action will leave a server with. Starting money is server.moneyAvailable. Note that when simulating the effect of [grow](./bitburner.ns.grow.md)<!-- -->, what matters is the state of the server and player when the grow \*finishes\*, not when it is started.

The growth amount depends both linearly \*and\* exponentially on threads; see [grow](./bitburner.ns.grow.md) for more details.

The inverse of this function is [formulas.hacking.growThreads](./bitburner.hackingformulas.growthreads.md)<!-- -->, although it rounds up to integer threads.

**Signature:**

```typescript
growAmount(server: Server, player: Person, threads: number, cores?: number): number;
```
