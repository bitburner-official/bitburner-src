## Methods

|  Method | Description |
|  --- | --- |
|  [growAmount(server, player, threads, cores)](./bitburner.hackingformulas.growamount.md) | <p>Calculate the amount of money a grow action will leave a server with. Starting money is server.moneyAvailable.</p><p>The growth amount depends both linearly \*and\* exponentially on threads; see [grow](./bitburner.ns.grow.md) for more details.</p><p>The inverse of this function is [formulas.hacking.growThreads](./bitburner.hackingformulas.growthreads.md)<!-- -->, although it rounds up to integer threads.</p> |
|  [growPercent(server, threads, player, cores)](./bitburner.hackingformulas.growpercent.md) | <p>Calculate the growth multiplier constant for a given server and threads.</p><p>The actual amount of money grown depends both linearly \*and\* exponentially on threads; this is only giving the exponential part that is used for the multiplier. See [grow](./bitburner.ns.grow.md) for more details.</p><p>As a result of the above, this multiplier does \*not\* depend on the amount of money on the server. Changing server.moneyAvailable and server.moneyMax will have no effect.</p><p>For the most common use-cases, you probably want either [formulas.hacking.growThreads](./bitburner.hackingformulas.growthreads.md) or [formulas.hacking.growAmount](./bitburner.hackingformulas.growamount.md) instead.</p> |
|  [growThreads(server, player, targetMoney, cores)](./bitburner.hackingformulas.growthreads.md) | <p>Calculate how many threads it will take to grow server to targetMoney. Starting money is server.moneyAvailable.</p><p>The growth amount depends both linearly \*and\* exponentially on threads; see [grow](./bitburner.ns.grow.md) for more details.</p><p>The inverse of this function is [formulas.hacking.growAmount](./bitburner.hackingformulas.growamount.md)<!-- -->, although it can work with fractional threads.</p> |
|  [growTime(server, player)](./bitburner.hackingformulas.growtime.md) | Calculate grow time. |
|  [hackChance(server, player)](./bitburner.hackingformulas.hackchance.md) | Calculate hack chance. (Ex: 0.25 would indicate a 25% chance of success.) |
|  [hackExp(server, player)](./bitburner.hackingformulas.hackexp.md) | Calculate hack exp for one thread. |
|  [hackPercent(server, player)](./bitburner.hackingformulas.hackpercent.md) | Calculate hack percent for one thread. (Ex: 0.25 would steal 25% of the server's current value.) |
|  [hackTime(server, player)](./bitburner.hackingformulas.hacktime.md) | Calculate hack time. |
|  [weakenTime(server, player)](./bitburner.hackingformulas.weakentime.md) | Calculate weaken time. |
