Opens a script’s logs. This is functionally the same as the tail Terminal command.

If the function is called with no arguments, it will open the current script’s logs.

Otherwise, the fn, hostname/ip, and args… arguments can be used to get the logs from another script. Remember that scripts are uniquely identified by both their names and arguments.

## Example


```js
//Open logs from foo.js on the current server that was run with no args
ns.tail("foo.js");

//Get logs from foo.js on the foodnstuff server that was run with no args
ns.tail("foo.js", "foodnstuff");

//Get logs from foo.js on the foodnstuff server that was run with the arguments [1, "test"]
ns.tail("foo.js", "foodnstuff", 1, "test");
```
