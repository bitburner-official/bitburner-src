## NS.setTitle() method

Set the title of the tail window of a script.

**Signature:**

```typescript
setTitle(title: string | React.ReactElement, pid?: number): void;
```

## Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |

|  pid | number | _(Optional)_ Optional. PID of the script having its tail closed. If omitted, the current script is used. |

**Returns:**

void

## Remarks

RAM cost: 0 GB

This sets the title to the given string, and also forces an update of the tail window's contents.

It is possible to pass a React Element instead, but this is mostly unsupported and may cause glitches or weird behavior - use at your own risk!

The title is saved across restarts, but only if it is a simple string.

If the pid is unspecified, it will modify the current scriptâ€™s logs.

Otherwise, the pid argument can be used to change the logs from another script.
