```

## Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  script | string | Filename of script to execute. |
|  threadOrOptions | number \| [SpawnOptions](./bitburner.spawnoptions.md) | _(Optional)_ Either an integer number of threads for new script, or a [SpawnOptions](./bitburner.spawnoptions.md) object. Threads defaults to 1 and spawnDelay defaults to 10,000 ms. |

## Remarks

RAM cost: 2 GB

Terminates the current script, and then after a defined delay it will execute the newly-specified script. The purpose of this function is to execute a new script without being constrained by the RAM usage of the current one. This function can only be used to run scripts on the local server.

Because this function immediately terminates the script, it does not have a return value.

Running this function with 0 or fewer threads will cause a runtime error.

## Example


```js
//The following example will execute the script ‘foo.js’ with 10 threads, in 500 milliseconds and the arguments ‘foodnstuff’ and 90:
ns.spawn('foo.js', {threads: 10, spawnDelay: 500}, 'foodnstuff', 90);
```
