## NFormatSpecialFlag type

Defines special behavior for nFormat.

"integer": Formats the number as an integer. The specified fractionalDigits will only be applied if the number is large enough for a suffix. This is how e.g. skills or hp are displayed ingame.

"percent": Formats the number as a percent. Never collapses to a suffixed form (treats suffixStart as Infinity)

"ram": Formats the number as an amount of ram. Ram is always suffixed (treats suffixStart as 0).

**Signature:**

```typescript
type NFormatSpecialFlag = "integer" | "percent" | "ram";
```
