## Corporation.nextUpdate() method

Sleep until the next Corporation update has happened.

**Signature:**

```typescript
nextUpdate(): Promise<CorpStateName>;
```
**Returns:**

Promise&lt;[CorpStateName](./bitburner.corpstatename.md)<!-- -->&gt;

Promise that resolves to the name of the state that was just processed.

I.e. when the state is PURCHASE, it means purchasing has just happened. Note that this is the state just before getCorporation().state.

Possible states are START, PURCHASE, PRODUCTION, EXPORT, SALE.

## Remarks

RAM cost: 1 GB

The amount of real time spent asleep between updates can vary due to "bonus time".
