|  [ramOverride?](./bitburner.spawnoptions.ramoverride.md) |  | number | <p>_(Optional)_ The RAM allocation to launch each thread of the script with.</p><p>Lowering this will <i>not</i> automatically let you get away with using less RAM: the dynamic RAM check enforces that all [NS](./bitburner.ns.md) functions actually called incur their cost. However, if you know that certain functions that are statically present (and thus included in the static RAM cost) will never be called in a particular circumstance, you can use this to avoid paying for them.</p><p>You can also use this to <i>increase</i> the RAM if the static RAM checker has missed functions that you need to call.</p><p>Must be greater-or-equal to the base RAM cost. Defaults to the statically calculated cost.</p> |
