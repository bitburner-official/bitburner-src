  /* To understand what is done below we need to do some math. I hope the explanation is clear enough.
   * First of, the names will be shortened for ease of manipulation:
   * n:= targetMoney (n for new), o:= startMoney (o for old), k:= calculateServerGrowthLog, x:= threads
   * x is what we are trying to compute.
   *
   * After growing, the money on a server is n = (o + x) * exp(k*x)
   * x appears in an exponent and outside it, this is usually solved using the productLog/lambert's W special function,
   * but it turns out that due to floating-point range issues this approach is *useless* to us, so it will be ignored.
   *
   * Instead, we proceed directly to Newton-Raphson iteration. We first rewrite the equation in
   * log-form, since iterating it this way has faster convergence: log(n) = log(o+x) + k*x.
   * Now our goal is to find the zero of f(x) = log((o+x)/n) + k*x.
   * (Due to the shape of the function, there will be a single zero.)
   *
   * The idea of this method is to take the horizontal position at which the horizontal axis
   * intersects with of the tangent of the function's curve as the next approximation.
   * It is equivalent to treating the curve as a line (it is called a first order approximation)
   * If the current approximation is x then the new approximated value is x - f(x)/f'(x)
   * (where f' is the derivative of f).
   *
   * In our case f(x) = log((o+x)/n) + k*x, f'(x) = d(log((o+x)/n) + k*x)/dx
   *                                              = 1/(o + x) + k
   * And the update step is x[new] = x - (log((o+x)/n) + k*x)/(1/(o+x) + k)
   * We can simplify this by bringing the first term up into the fraction:
   * = (x * (1/(o+x) + k) - log((o+x)/n) - k*x) / (1/(o+x) + k)
   * = (x/(o+x) - log((o+x)/n)) / (1/(o+x) + k)    [multiplying top and bottom by (o+x)]
   * = (x - (o+x)*log((o+x)/n)) / (1 + (o+x)*k)
   *
   * The main question to ask when using this method is "does it converge?"
   * (are the approximations getting better?), if it does then it does quickly.
   * Since the derivative is always positive but also strictly decreasing, convergence is guaranteed.
   * This also provides the useful knowledge that any x which starts *greater* than the solution will
   * undershoot across to the left, while values *smaller* than the zero will continue to find
   * closer approximations that are still smaller than the final value.
   *
   * Of great importance for reducing the number of iterations is starting with a good initial
   * guess. We use a very simple starting condition: x_0 = n - o. We *know* this will always overshot
   * the target, usually by a vast amount. But we can run it manually through one Newton iteration
   * to get a better start with nice properties:
   * x_1 = ((n - o) - (n - o + o)*log((n-o+o)/n)) / (1 + (n-o+o)*k)
   *     = ((n - o) - n * log(n/n)) / (1 + n*k)
   *     = ((n - o) - n * 0) / (1 + n*k)
   *     = (n - o) / (1 + n*k)
   * We can do the same procedure with the exponential form of Newton's method, starting from x_0 = 0.
   * This gives x_1 = (n - o) / (1 + o*k), (full derivation omitted) which will be an overestimate.
   * We use a weighted average of the denominators to get the final guess:
   *   x = (n - o) / (1 + (1/16*n + 15/16*o)*k)
   * The reason for this particular weighting is subtle; it is exactly representable and holds up
   * well under a wide variety of conditions, making it likely that the we start within 1 thread of
   * correct. It particularly bounds the worst-case to 3 iterations, and gives a very wide swatch
   * where 2 iterations is good enough.
   *
   * The accuracy of the initial guess is good for many inputs - often one iteration
   * is sufficient. This means the overall cost is two logs (counting the one in calculateServerGrowthLog),
   * possibly one exp, 5 divisions, and a handful of basic arithmetic.
