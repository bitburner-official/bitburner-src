## RunOptions.ramOverride property

The RAM allocation to launch each thread of the script with.

Lowering this will <i>not</i> automatically let you get away with using less RAM: the dynamic RAM check enforces that all [NS](./bitburner.ns.md) functions actually called incur their cost. However, if you know that certain functions that are statically present (and thus included in the static RAM cost) will never be called in a particular circumstance, you can use this to avoid paying for them.

You can also use this to <i>increase</i> the RAM if the static RAM checker has missed functions that you need to call.

Must be greater-or-equal to the base RAM cost. Defaults to the statically calculated cost.

**Signature:**

```typescript
ramOverride?: number;
```
