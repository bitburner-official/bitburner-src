## Hacknet.upgradeRam() method

Upgrade the RAM of a hacknet node.

**Signature:**

```typescript
upgradeRam(index: number, n?: number): boolean;
```

## Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  index | number | Index/Identifier of Hacknet Node. |
|  n | number | _(Optional)_ Number of times to upgrade RAM. Must be positive. Rounded to nearest integer. Defaults to 1 if not specified. |

**Returns:**

boolean

True if the Hacknet Node’s RAM is successfully upgraded, false otherwise.

## Remarks

RAM cost: 0 GB

Returns false otherwise.
