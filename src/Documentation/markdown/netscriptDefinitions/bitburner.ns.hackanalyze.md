Like other basic hacking analysis functions, this calculation uses the current status of the player and server. To calculate using hypothetical server or player status, obtain access to the Formulas API and use [formulas.hacking.hackPercent](./bitburner.hackingformulas.hackpercent.md)<!-- -->.

## Example


```js
//For example, assume the following returns 0.01:
const hackAmount = ns.hackAnalyze("foodnstuff");
//This means that if hack the foodnstuff server using a single thread, then you will steal 1%, or 0.01 of its total money. If you hack using N threads, then you will steal N*0.01 times its total money.
```
