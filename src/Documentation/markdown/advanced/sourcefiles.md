# Source-Files

Source-Files are a type of persistent upgrade that is more powerful than [Augmentations](../basic/augmentations.md).
Source-Files are received by destroying a [Bitnode](bitnodes.md). There are many different [BitNodes](bitnodes.md)
in the game and each [BitNode](bitnodes.md) will grant a different Source-File when it is destroyed.

A Source-File can be upgraded by destroying its corresponding [BitNode](bitnodes.md) a second or
third time (playing through that [BitNode](bitnodes.md) again). It can be upgraded to a maximum
of level 3, with the exception of Source-File 12, which has no hard limit.
