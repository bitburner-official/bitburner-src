# Augmentations

Advances in science and medicine have led to powerful new technologies
that allow people to augment themselves beyond normal human capabilities.
There are many different types of Augmentations, ranging from cybernetic
to genetic to biological. Acquiring these Augmentations enhances the
user's physical and mental faculties.

Augmentations provide persistent upgrades in the form of multipliers.
These multipliers apply to a wide variety of things such as stats,
experience gain, and [hacking](hacking.md), just to name a few. The effects of
Augmentations stack multiplicatively. Your multipliers can be viewed in
the `Character` pages.

## How to acquire Augmentations

Because of how powerful Augmentations are, the technology behind them
is kept private and secret by the corporations and organizations that
create them. Therefore, the only way for the player to obtain
Augmentations is through [Factions](factions.md). After joining a [Faction](factions.md) and earning
enough [Reputation](reputation.md) in it, you will be able to purchase its Augmentations.
Different [Factions](factions.md) offer different Augmentations. Augmentations must be
purchased in order to be installed, and they are fairly expensive. They also require [Reputation](reputation.md) from a [Factions](factions.md) before they will let you purchase their Augmentations.

## Installing Augmentations

You will not gain the benefits of your purchased Augmentations until you install them. You can choose to install Augmentations through
the `Augmentations` menu tab, found under `Character`.

Unfortunately, installing Augmentations has side effects. You will lose
most of the progress you've made, including your skills, stats, and
money. You will have to start over, but you will have all of the
Augmentations you have installed to help you progress. This is the
game's "soft reset" or "prestige" mechanic.

To summarize, here is a list of everything you will **LOSE** when you install
an Augmentation:

- Stats/Skills
- Money
- [Scripts](scripts.md) on all [servers](servers.md) EXCEPT your home computer
- Purchased [servers](servers.md)
- [Hacknet Nodes](hacknet_nodes.md)
- [Company](companies.md) / [Faction](factions.md) [Reputation](reputation.md), but you gain [Reputation](reputation.md).
- Jobs and [Faction](factions.md) memberships
- Programs
- [Stocks](stockmarket.md)
- TOR router

Here is everything you will KEEP when you install an Augmentation:

- Every Augmentation you have installed
- [Scripts](scripts.md) on your home computer
- [RAM](ram.md) / Core Upgrades on your home computer
- [World Stock Exchange account](stockmarket.md) and [TIX API](https://github.com/bitburner-official/bitburner-src/blob/dev/markdown/bitburner.tix.md) Access
- Previously installed Augmentations

## Purchasing Multiple Augmentations

You do not have to install an Augmentation right after you purchase it.
You can purchase as many Augmentations as you'd like before you choose to
install them. When you install your purchased Augmentations they will **ALL**
get installed at once.

There are a few drawbacks to this, however. First, obviously, you won't
gain the benefits of your purchased Augmentations until after you install
them. Second, purchasing multiple Augmentations before installing them
will cause the Augmentations to get progressively more expensive. When
you purchase an Augmentation, the price of purchasing another Augmentation
doubles. This multiplier stacks for each Augmentation you
purchase. Once you install your purchased Augmentations, their costs
are reset back to the original prices. You can only purchase each augmentation
once, with the exception of `NeuroFlux Governor`, which can be purchased infinitely
at increasing cost.
