# Reputation

In order to acquire [Augmentations](augmentations.md) from [Factions](factions.md) you need to acquire their trust.

This can be done in a variety of ways but the most common is offering your services to a [Faction](faction.md). But also from [Infiltrations](infiltration.md).

When installing [Augmentations](augmentations.md) all your reputation gets converted to favor. Favor increases the rate at which reputation is gained with that faction.

With enough favor, donations are unlocked. Donations allow you to spend money to acquire reputation directly. Without working for the faction. This feature is particularily useful when a very large amount of reputation is needed for an augmentation.
