# Hacknet Servers

These are a very powerful upgrade to [Hacknet Nodes](../basic/hacknet_nodes.md). Instead of producing money the Hacknet Servers produce `hashes`. This currency can be exchanged for a variety of upgrade that boost most other mechanics of the game.

They can also be used to run scripts on. However this reduces the amount of `hash` produced.
