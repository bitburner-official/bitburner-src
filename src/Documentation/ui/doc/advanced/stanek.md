# Stanek

Allison is a bit crazy. But her special [Augmentation](../basic/augmentations.md) is very useful despites it's ~~bugs~~ features. The Gift is consists of a grid of squares in which tetris-like pieces called fragments can be placed. Each fragment boost a different player multiplier. However the fragments are not very powerful by themselves.

To increase the power of a fragment the `ns.stanek.charge()` function needs to be called. More thread means more power.

There are also special fragments called booster fragments which increase the power of the fragment it touches.
