# Intelligence

Intelligence is a stat that is unlocked by having
[Source-File 5](sourcefiles.md) (i.e. Destroying [BitNode-5](bitnodes.md)).

Intelligence is unique because it is permanent and persistent. It never gets reset
back to 1. However, gaining Intelligence experience is extremely slow. It is a stat
that gradually builds up as you continue to play the game.

Intelligence will boost your production for many actions in the game, including:

- [Hacking](../basic/hacking.md)
- [Infiltration](../basic/infiltration.md)
- [Crime](../basic/crimes.md) success rate
- [Bladeburner](bladeburners.md) actions
- [Reputation](../basic/reputation.md) gain for [Companies](../basic//companies.md) & [Factions](../basic/factions.md)
- [Augmentation](../basic/augmentations.md) [Grafting](grafting.md) speed
