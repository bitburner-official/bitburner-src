# RAM

In bitburner RAM determines how many [Scripts](scripts.md) can run on a [Server](servers.md).

Multiplying the number of threads a [Script](scripts.md) uses multiplies it RAM cost but also multiplies the effectiveness of several functions, like `ns.hack()`, `ns.grow()`, and `ns.weaken()`.

You can purchase more RAM for your home computer from tech vendors. You can also use other computers as source of additional RAM.
