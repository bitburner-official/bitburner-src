# Crimes

Committing crimes is an active gameplay mechanic that allows the player to train their [Stats](stats.md) and potentially earn money.
The player can attempt to commit crimes by visiting `The Slums` through the `City` tab (Alt + w).
`The Slums` is available in every city.

## Basic Mechanics

When you visit `The Slums` you will see a list of buttons that show all of the available crimes.
Simply select one of the options to begin attempting that crime.
Attempting to commit a crime takes a certain amount of time.
This time varies between crimes.

While doing crimes, you can click `Do something else simultaneously` to be able to do things while you continue to do crimes in the background.
There is a 20% penalty to the related gains.
Clicking the `Focus` button under the overview will return you to the current task.

Crimes are not always successful.
Your rate of success is determined by your [Stats](stats.md) and [Augmentations](augmentations.md).
The odds can be seen on the crime-selection page.
If you are unsuccessful at committing a crime you will gain EXP, but you will not earn money.
If you are successful at committing the crime you will gain extra EXP (4x of what an unsuccessful attempt would give) and earn money.

Harder crimes are typically more profitable, and also give more EXP.
