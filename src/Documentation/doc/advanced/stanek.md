# Stanek

Allison is a bit crazy.
But her special [Augmentation](../basic/augmentations.md) is very useful despite its ~~bugs~~ features.
The Gift consists of a grid of squares in which Tetris-like pieces called fragments can be placed.
Each fragment boost a different player multiplier.
However, the fragments are not very powerful by themselves.

To increase the power of a fragment, the `ns.stanek.charge()` function needs to be called.
More threads means more power.

There are also special fragments called booster fragments which increase the power of the fragment it touches.
