## Upgrade

Each upgrade has different `BasePrice`, `PriceMult`, `Benefit.

Most upgrades affect all divisions.

There are 3 special upgrades. These upgrades only affect its division and have different formulas for cost/benefits.
- Warehouse. Check this [part](./warehouse.md).
- Office. Check this [part](./office.md).
- Advert. Check this [part](./wilson-analytics-advert.md).

Normal upgrade's formulas:
- Upgrade cost:

$$UpgradeCost = BasePrice*{PriceMult}^{UpgradeCurrentLevel}$$

- Upgrade cost from level 0 to level n:

$$(UpgradeCost)_{From\ 0\ to\ n} = \sum_{k = 0}^{n - 1}{BasePrice*PriceMult}^{k}$$

≡

$$(UpgradeCost)_{From\ 0\ to\ n} = BasePrice*\left( \frac{1 - {PriceMult}^{n}}{1 - PriceMult} \right)$$

≡

$$(UpgradeCost)_{From\ 0\ to\ n} = BasePrice*\left( \frac{{PriceMult}^{n} - 1}{PriceMult - 1} \right)$$

- Upgrade cost level a to level b:

$$(UpgradeCost)_{From\ a\ to\ b} = \sum_{k = 0}^{b - 1}{BasePrice*PriceMult}^{k} - \sum_{k = 0}^{a - 1}{BasePrice*PriceMult}^{k}$$

≡

$$(UpgradeCost)_{From\ a\ to\ b} = BasePrice*\left( \frac{{PriceMult}^{b} - 1}{PriceMult - 1} \right) - BasePrice*\left( \frac{{PriceMult}^{a} - 1}{PriceMult - 1} \right)$$

≡

$$(UpgradeCost)_{From\ a\ to\ b} = BasePrice*\left( \frac{{PriceMult}^{b} - {PriceMult}^{a}}{PriceMult - 1} \right)$$

- Maximum upgrade level with a given `MaxCost`:

$$MaxUpgradeLevel = \log_{PriceMult}\left( MaxCost*\frac{PriceMult - 1}{BasePrice} + (PriceMult)^{CurrentLevel} \right)$$

- Benefit:
  - All benefits are multipliers. `BaseBenefit` is 1.
  - The only exception is DreamSense. Its benefit is raw value, its `BaseBenefit` is 0.

$$Benefit = BaseBenefit + Benefit*CurrentLevel$$

## Research

Each research has a set of multipliers. For example: `sciResearchMult`, `productionMult`, etc.

Benefit of research type is the product of all research's multiplier of the same type.

Advices:
- Do not deplete entire RP pool to buy research. You should only buy research if it costs less than half of the RP pool. Personally, my conditions for buying researches are:
  - For energy/morale and employee's stats: if it costs less than 20% of RP pool.
  - For production: if it costs less than 10% of RP pool.
- If you don't have custom Market-TA2 script, you must prioritize Market-TA1 and Market-TA2. Market-TA1 is useless, the only reason to buy it is because it's the prerequisite of Market-TA2. If you buy them, you should stock up on RP and buy them together. However, I recommend implementing custom Market-TA2 ASAP. Market-TA1 and Market-TA2 cost 70000 RP, that's a huge number of RP at the start of round 3+. **Implementing custom Market-TA2 script is the best optimization in round 3+.**
- After that, you should prioritize researches for higher maximum energy/morale and employee's stats over production. Researches for production are nice to have, but it's much less important than energy/morale/employee's stats.
- My research order for higher maximum energy/morale and employee's stats: Overclock → Sti.mu → Automatic Drug Administration → Go-Juice → CPH4 Injections.
- Do not buy these useless researches:
  - uPgrade: Dashboard
  - AutoBrew
  - AutoPartyManager
  - HRBuddy-Recruitment
  - HRBuddy-Training
- In most cases, uPgrade: Capacity.I and uPgrade: Capacity.II are useless. New product is usually much better than old products, so there is no point in increasing maximum number of products. The only exception is when you reach the endgame. In endgame, new product is only marginally better than old products, so having more product slots may be beneficial. However, even in endgame, those researches may do more harm than good. In endgame, the warehouse's size and high-quality input materials are serious bottlenecks. Having more product slots means that you need more free space in the warehouse and more units of input materials. There are cases that increasing product slots actually reduces the overall profit. You need to fine-tune it per use case.

You can exchange hashes for RP if you have SF9. This number of RP is added to all divisions.

RP gain rate:
- RP is increased in 4 states: PURCHASE, PRODUCTION, EXPORT and SALE.
- RP gain per city per state:

$$RnDProduction = office.employeeProductionByJob["Research\ \&\ Development"]$$

$$RPGain = 0.004*(RnDProduction)^{0.5}*UpgradeMultiplier*ResearchMultiplier$$

- Industry's `ScienceFactor` does not affect RP gain rate.
