# Corporation

Corporation is an interesting feature of Bitburner. It's the most profitable feature in the game, and it's so overpowered that many BitNodes tend to apply a penalty modifier. However, it's extremely complex and opaque for newbies. There are too many mechanisms that are intertwined with each other, so it's very easy to make a mistake, and that mistake can cripple your corporation. This documentation explains all the mechanisms that you need to know to build a successful corporation.

The documentation is a bit long and intimidating at first glance, but you don't need to read all the sections below at once. I recommend that you read the first 4 sections. They are the most important sections for newbies. After that, you can read the following sections at your leisure.
