# Bladeburners

Bladeburner divisions were created internationally in the mid-21st century. Tasked with monitoring and "managing" rogue Synthoids, which may have blended into society and are sometimes considered a threat, working for Bladeburners gives access to powerful enhancements and a goal of destroying [BitNodes](bitnodes.md) by operating against increasingly strong Synthoid opposition.

## Bladeburner Skills:

Designed to improve a human agent's capabilities beyond their natural limits, Bladeburner skills add a persistent bonus while in the [BitNode](bitnodes.md) where they were purchased. Bladeburner skills are purchased with Bladeburner skill points, not money.

## Faction and Rank:

Bladeburners also offer unique [Augmentations](../basic/augmentations.md) and a [Faction](factions.md) invite to agents who "put in the work" to gain a small amount of rank. While Bladeburner rank and skill points persist after any augmentation installs, faction reputation will be reset. Bladeburner faction reputation can only be gained through Bladeburner actions.
