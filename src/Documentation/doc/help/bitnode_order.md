# What BitNode should I do?

After destroying their first [BitNode](../advanced/bitnodes.md), many players wonder which [BitNode](../advanced/bitnodes.md) they should tackle next.
This guide hopefully helps answer that question.

## Recommended BitNodes

As a player, you are not forced to tackle the [BitNodes](../advanced/bitnodes.md) in any particular order.
You are free to choose whichever ones you want.
The "best" order can vary between players, depending on what you like to do any what kind of player you are.
In general, here are the recommended [BitNodes](../advanced/bitnodes.md) for different things:

## For fast progression

These paths do not recommend the absolute fastest path, since speed of progression is highly dependant on playing style.

1. Repeat BN-1 until you max out its [Source-File](../advanced/sourcefiles.md).
   Its [Source-File](../advanced/sourcefiles.md) is extremely powerful, as it raises all multipliers by a significant amount.
   This also allows you to get used to augments and other features resetting.

2. Do BN-3 at least once to unlock the [Corporation](../advanced/corporations.md) mechanic, finishing all 3 levels unlocks the full API for free, allowing fully scripted corp.
   This mechanic has the highest profit potential in the game.

3. Do BN-10 once to unlock [Sleeves](../advanced/sleeves.md) and [Grafting](../advanced/grafting.md).
   [Sleeves](../advanced/sleeves.md) are useful in all nodes and grafting can be useful in future [BitNodes](../advanced/bitnodes.md), especially BN-8.
   It's recommended to buy all purchasable [Sleeves](../advanced/sleeves.md) and their memory during the first run.

   The ordering of the next three is dependant on playing style and wants/needs.

4. Do BN-5 once or twice.
   The [Intelligence](../advanced/intelligence.md) stat it unlocks will gradually build up as you continue to play the game, and will be helpful in the future.
   The [Source-File](../advanced/sourcefiles.md) also provides [hacking](../basic/hacking.md) multipliers, which are strong because [hacking](../basic/hacking.md) is typically one of the best ways of earning money.

5. Do BN-4. Its [Source-File](../advanced/sourcefiles.md) does not directly make you more powerful in any way, but unlocks the [Singularity API](https://github.com/bitburner-official/bitburner-src/blob/dev/markdown/bitburner.singularity.md).
   This API allows you to automate significantly more aspects of the game.
   Consider repeating until Level 3, since each level decreases the [RAM](../basic/ram.md) cost of the functions.

6. Do BN-2 once to unlock the [Gang](../advanced/gang.md) mechanic.
   This mechanic has high profit potential and offers large amounts of [Augmentations](../basic/augmentations.md) in a single faction.
   Having sleeves ([Source-File](../advanced/sourcefiles.md) 10) greatly reduces the time it takes to get access to [Gangs](../advanced/gang.md) outside this [BitNode](../advanced/bitnodes.md).

7. Do BN-9 to unlock the [Hacknet Server](../advanced/hacknetservers.md) mechanic.
   You can consider repeating it as well, as its Level 2 and 3 effects are pretty helpful as well.

## For the strongest Source-Files

Note that the strongest [Source-Files](../advanced/sourcefiles.md) are typically rewarded by the hardest [BitNodes](../advanced/bitnodes.md).

The strongest [Source-File](../advanced/sourcefiles.md) is that from BN-1, as it raises all multipliers by a significant amount.

The [Source-File](../advanced/sourcefiles.md) from BN-9 is good because it unlocks the Hacknet Server mechanic.
The [Hacknet Server](../advanced/hacknetservers.md) mechanic causes [Hacknet Nodes](../basic/hacknet_nodes.md) to produce a new currency called `hashes`, rather than money.
`Hashes` can be spent on powerful upgrades that benefit your [hacking](../basic/hacking.md), [Corporation](../advanced/corporations.md), [Bladeburner](../advanced/bladeburners.md), etc.

The [Sleeves](../advanced/sleeves.md) granted by the [Source-File](../advanced/sourcefiles.md) from BN-10 are strong, but only after you have several of them and have spent some time/money upgrading them.

## For more scripting/hacking

BN-4 unlocks the [Singularity API](https://github.com/bitburner-official/bitburner-src/blob/dev/markdown/bitburner.singularity.md), which can be used to automate many different aspects of the game, including working for [Factions](../basic/factions.md) / [Companies](../basic/companies.md), purchasing & installing [Augmentations](../basic/augmentations.md), and creating programs

BN-6 and BN-7 unlock [Bladeburner](../advanced/bladeburners.md) and its corresponding [Bladeburner API](https://github.com/bitburner-official/bitburner-src/blob/dev/markdown/bitburner.bladeburner.md).
This allows you to automate an entire new mechanic.

BN-2 also unlocks a new mechanic and API for automating the [Gang](../advanced/gang.md) mechanic.
However, it is not as interesting as [Bladeburner](../advanced/bladeburners.md)

BN-9 unlocks the [Hacknet Server](../advanced/hacknetservers.md) mechanic and several new functions in the [Hacknet Node API](https://github.com/bitburner-official/bitburner-src/blob/dev/markdown/bitburner.hacknet.md) for using it.

## For new mechanics

BN-2 unlocks a new mechanic in which you can manage a [Gang](../advanced/gang.md).
[Gangs](../advanced/gang.md) earn you money and can be very profitable once they get large and powerful.
The biggest benefit of [Gangs](../advanced/gang.md), however, is that they make all [Augmentations](../basic/augmentations.md) available to you through their corresponding [Faction](../basic/factions.md).

BN-3 unlocks a new mechanic in which you can manage a [Corporation](../advanced/corporations.md).
You can earn money through [Corporations](../advanced/corporations.md) by selling your stocks, or by configuring your [Corporation](../advanced/corporations.md) to pay dividends to shareholders.
If your [Corporation](../advanced/corporations.md) gets big enough, it can also bribe [Factions](../basic/factions.md) in exchange for [Faction](../basic/factions.md) [Reputation](../basic/reputation.md).

BN-6 unlocks a new mechanic that centers around combat rather than hacking.
The main benefit of the [Bladeburner](../advanced/bladeburners.md) mechanic is that it offers a new method of destroying a [BitNode](../advanced/bitnodes.md).

BN-9 unlocks the [Hacknet Server](../advanced/hacknetservers.md), which is an upgraded version of a [Hacknet Node](../basic/hacknet_nodes.md).
The [Hacknet Server](../advanced/hacknetservers.md) generates a computational unit called a `hash`.
`Hashes` can be spent on a variety of different upgrades that can benefit your hacking, [Corporation](../advanced/corporations.md), [Bladeburner](../advanced/bladeburners.md) progress, and more.
It transforms the [Hacknet Node](../basic/hacknet_nodes.md) from a simple money-generator to a more interesting mechanic.

BN-10 unlocks two new mechanics: [Sleeves](../advanced/sleeves.md) and [Grafting](../advanced/grafting.md)

BN-13 unlocks [Stanek's Gift](../advanced/stanek.md). This gift can improve skills, [hacknet](../basic/hacknet_nodes.md) production and costs, working and [crime](../basic/crimes.md) gains, and [hacking](../basic/hacking.md) power and speed.

## For a Challenge

In general, the higher [BitNodes](../advanced/bitnodes.md) are more difficult than the lower ones.
BN-12 is an obvious exception as it gets progressively harder.

BN-8 provides a unique challenge, as the only method of earning money in that [BitNode](../advanced/bitnodes.md) is through trading at the stock market.
