## Automating IPvGO

IPvGO is a strategic territory control minigame accessible from DefComm in New Tokyo, or the CIA in Sector-12. Form networks of routers on a grid to control open space and gain stat multipliers and favor, but make sure the opposing faction does not surround and destroy your network!

For basic instructions, go to DefComm or CIA to access the current subnet, and look through the "How to Play" section. This document is specifically focused on building scripts to automate subnet takeover, which will be more applicable you have played a few subnets.

&nbsp;

#### Overview

The rules of Go, at their heart, are very simple. Because of this, they can be used to make a very simple script to automatically collect node power from IPvGO subnets.

This script can be iteratively improved upon, gradually giving it more tools and types of move to look for, and becoming more consistent at staking out territory on the current subnet.

This document starts out with a lot of detail and example code to get you started, but will transition to more high-level algorithm design and pseudocode as it progresses. If you get stuck implementing some of these ideas, feel free to discuss in the [official Discord server](https://discord.gg/TFc3hKD)

&nbsp;

### Script outline: Starting with the basics

&nbsp;

#### Testing Validity

The `ns.go` API provides a number of useful tools to understand the current subnet state.

`ns.go.analysis.getValidMoves()` returns a 2D array of true/false, indicating if you can place a router on the current square.

You can test if a given move `x,y` is valid with a test like this:

```js
const validMoves = ns.go.analysis.getValidMoves();

if (validMoves[x][y] === true) {
  // Do something
}
```

&nbsp;

#### Choosing a random move

The simplest move type, and the fallback if no other move can be found, is to pick a random valid move.

The `validMoves` grid can be retrieved using `getValidMoves()` as mentioned above. `board` comes from `ns.go.getBoardState()`, more on that later.

It would be a problem to fill in every single node on the board, however. If networks ever lose contact with any empty nodes, they will be destroyed! So, leave some "airspace" by excluding certain moves from the random ones we select.

One way to do this is to exclude nodes with both even X coordinate and even y coordinate:

```js
/**
 * Choose one of the empty points on the board at random to play
 */
const getRandomMove = (board, validMoves) => {
  const moveOptions = [];
  const size = board[0].length;

  // Look through all the points on the board
  for (let x = 0; x < size; x++) {
    for (let y = 0; y < size; y++) {
      // Make sure the point is a valid move
      const isValidMove = validMoves[x][y] === true;
      // Leave some spaces to make it harder to capture our pieces.
      // We don't want to run out of empty node connections!
      const isNotReservedSpace = x % 2 === 1 || y % 2 === 1;

      if (isValidMove && isNotReservedSpace) {
        moveOptions.push([x, y]);
      }
    }
  }

  // Choose one of the found moves at random
  const randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * moveOptions.length);
  return mbveOptions[randomIndex] ?? [];
};
```

This idea can also be improved to focus on a specific area or corner first, rather than spread across the whole board right away.

&nbsp;

#### Playing moves

Now that a simple move type is available, it can be used to play on the current subnet!

`await ns.go.makeMove(x, y)` can be used to play a chosen move `x,y`. Note that it returns a `Promise`, meaning it needs to be used with `await`.

`await ns.go.passTurn()` can be used if no moves are found. This will end the game if the AI also passes (or just passed previously).

Both `makeMove()` and `passTurn()` , when awaited, return an object that tells you if your move was valid and successfully played, and what the AI's response is.

```js
{
  // If your move was successfully applied to the subnet
  success: boolean;
  // If the opponent moved or passed, or if the game is now over, or if your move was invalid
  type: "invalid" | "move" | "pass" | "gameOver";
  x: number; // Opponent move's x coord (if applicable)
  y: number; // Opponent move's y coord (if applicable)
}
```

&nbsp;

When used together with the `getRandomMove()` implemented above, the framework of the script is ready. An example `main()` that implements this is below. Search for a new subnet using the UI, then launch the script you have been working on, and watch it play!

```js
/** @param {NS} ns */
export async function main(ns) {
  let result, x, y;

  do {
    const board = ns.go.getBoardState();
    const validMoves = ns.go.analysis.getValidMoves();

    const [randX, randY] = getRandomMove(board, validMoves);
    // TODO: more move options

    // Choose a move from our options (currently just "random move")
    x = randX;
    y = randY;

    if (x === undefined) {
      // Pass turn if no moves are found
      result = await ns.go.passTurn();
    } else {
      // Play the selected move
      result = await ns.go.makeMove(x, y);
    }

    await ns.sleep(200);

    // Keep looping as long as the opponent is playing moves
  } while (result?.type !== "gameOver");

  // After the opponent passes, end the game by passing as well
  await ns.go.passTurn();

  // TODO: add a loop to keep playing
  // TODO: reset board, e.g. `ns.go.resetBoardState("Netburners", 7)`
}
```

&nbsp;

### Adding network expansion moves

Just playing random moves is not very effective, though. The next step is to use the board state to try and take over territory.

`ns.go.getBoardState()` returns a simple grid representing what the current board looks like. The player's routers are marked with `X`, and the opponents with `O`.

Example 5x5 board state, with a number of networks for each player:

```angularjs
[  "XX.O.",
   "X..OO",
   ".XO..",
   "XXO..",
   ".XOO.", ]
```

The board state can be used to look at all the nodes touching a given point, by looking at an adjacent pair of coordinates.

For example, the point to the 'north' of the current point `x, y` can be retrieved with `board[x + 1]?.[y]`. If it is a friendly router it will have value `"X"`. (It will be undefined if `x,y` is on the north edge of the subnet)

That info can be used to make decisions about where to place routers.

In order to expand the area that is controlled by the player's networks, connecting to friendly routers (when possible) is a strong move. This can be done with a very similar implementation to `getRandomMove()`, with the additional check of looking for a neighboring friendly router. For each point on the board:

```
Detect expansion moves:
   For each point on the board:
      * If the emtpy point is a valid move, and
      * If the point is not an open space reserved to protect the network [see getRandomMove()], and
      * If a point to the north, south, east, or west is a friendly router

      Then, the move will expand an existing network
```

When possible, an expansion move like this should be used over a random move. When neither can be found, pass turn.

This idea can be improved: reserved spaces can be skipped if the nodes are in different networks. Se `ns.go.analysis.getChains()`

After implementing this, the script will consistently get points on the subnet against most opponents (at least on the larger boards), and will sometimes even get lucky and win against the easiest factions.

&nbsp;

#### Next Steps

There is a lot we can still do to improve the script. For one, it currently only plays one game, and must be restarted each time! Also, it does not re-set the subnet upon game completion yet.

In addition, the script only knows about a few types of moves, and does not yet know how to capture or defend networks.

&nbsp;

#### Killing duplicate scripts

Because there is only one subnet active at any time, you do not want multiple copies of your scripts running and competing with each other.

This snippet can be added to any script, and will kill any other scripts with the same file name on the current server. Put this code into your script and call it at the top of main() using `killDuplicates(ns)`

```js
/** @param {NS} ns */
function killDuplicates(ns) {
  const scriptInfo = ns.getRunningScript();
  ns.ps()
    .filter((script) => script.filename === scriptInfo.filename && script.pid !== scriptInfo.pid)
    .forEach((script) => ns.kill(script.pid));
}
```

### Move option: Capturing the opponent's networks

If the opposing faction's network is down to its last open port, placing a router in that empty node will capture and destroy that entire network.

To find out what networks are in danger of capture, `ns.go.analysis.getLiberties()` shows how many empty nodes / open ports each network has. As with `getBoardState()` and `getValidMoves()` , the number of liberties (open ports) for a given point's network can be retrieved via its coordinates `[x][y]` on the grid returned by `getLiberties()`

```
Detect moves to capture the opponent's routers:
   For each point on the board:
      * If the emtpy point is a valid move, and
      * If a point to the north, south, east, or west is a router with exactly 1 liberty [via its coordinates in getLiberties()], and
      * That point is controlled by the opponent [it is a "O" via getBoardState()]

      Then, playing that move will capture the opponent's network.
```

&nbsp;

### Move option: Defending your networks from capture

`getLiberties()` can also be used to detect your own networks that are in danger of being captured, and look for moves to try and save it.

```
Detect moves to defend a threatened network:
   For each point on the board:
      * If the emtpy point is a valid move, and
      * If a point to the north, south, east, or west is a router with exactly 1 liberty [via its coordinates in getLiberties()], and
      * That point is controlled by the player [it is a "X" via getBoardState()]

      Then, that network is in danger of being captured.


   To detect if that network can be saved:

   * Ensure the new move will not immediately allow the opponent to capture:
      * That empty point ALSO has two or more empty points adjacent to it [a "." via getBoardState()], OR
      * That empty point has a friendly network adjacent to it, and that network has 3 or more liberties [via getLiberties()]

      Then, playing that move will prevent your network from being captured (at least for a turn or two)
```

&nbsp;

### Move option: Smothering the opponent's networks

In some cases, an opponent's network cannot YET be captured, but by placing routers all around it, the network can be captured on a future move. (Or at least you force the opponent to spend moves defending their network.)

There are many ways to approach this, but the simplest is to look for any opposing network with the fewest liberties remaining (ideally 2), and find a safe point to place a router that touches it.

To make sure the move will not immediately get re-captured, make sure the point you play on has two adjacent empty nodes, or is touching a friendly network with three+ liberties. (This is the same as the check in the move to defend a friendly chain.)

&nbsp;

### Move option: Expanding your networks' connections to empty nodes

The more empty nodes a network touches, the stronger it is, and the more territory it influences. Thus, placing routers that touch a friendly network and also to as many open nodes as possible is often a strong move.

This is similar to the logic for defending your networks from immediate capture. Look for a friendly network with the fewest open ports, and find an empty node adjacent to it that touches multiple other empty nodes.

&nbsp;

### Move option: Encircling space to control empty nodes

&nbsp;

### Choosing a good move option

Having multiple plausible moves to select from is helpful, but choosing the right option is important to making a strong Go script. In some cases, if a move type is available, it is almost always worth playing (such as defending your network from immediate capture, or capturing a vulnerable enemy network)

Each of the IPvGO factions has a few moves they will almost always choose (The Black hand will always capture if possible, for example). Coming up with a simple prioritized list is a good start to compete with these scripts. Experiment to see what works best!

This idea can be improved, however, by including information such as the size of the network that is being threatened or that is vulnerable to capture. It is probably worth giving up one router in exchange for capturing a large enemy network, for example. Adding two new open ports to a large network is helpful, but limiting an opponent's network to one open port might be better.

&nbsp;

### Other types of move options

**Preparing to invade the opponent**

Empty areas that are completely surrounded and controlled by a single player can be seen via `ns.go.analysis.getControlledEmptyNodes()`. However, just because the area is currently controlled by the opponent does not mean it cannot be attacked! Start by surrounding an opponent's network from the outside, then it can be captured by attacking the space it surrounds and controls. (Note that this only works on networks that have a single interior empty space: if they have multiple inner empty points, the suicide rule prevents you from filling any of them)

**Wrapping empty space**

The starting script uses some very simple logic to leave open empty nodes inside its networks (simply excluding points with `x % 2 === 0 && y % 2 === 0`). However, it is very strong to look for ways to actively surround empty space.

Look for moves that connect a network to the edge of a board that touch an empty node, or look for moves that connect two networks and touch an empty node. Or, look for a move that touches a friendly network and splits apart a chain of empty nodes.

**Jumps and Knights' moves**

The factions currently only look at moves directly connected to friendly or enemy networks in most cases. however, especially on the larger board, playing a router a few spaces away from an existing line/network allows the player to influence more territory, compared to slower moves that connect one adjacent node at a time. Consider skipping a node or two, or playing diagonally, or combining them to make L shaped jumps (like a knight's move in chess)

**Pattern Matching**

There are a lot of strong shapes in Go, that are worth attempting to re-create. The factions look for ways to slip diagonally between the players' networks and cut them apart. They also look for ways to wrap around isolated opposing routers. Consider making a small library of strong shapes, then looking to match them on the board (or their rotations or mirrors). The exact shapes will require some research into Go, but there is a lot of good documentation online about this idea.

**Creating "Eyes"**

If a single network fully encloses two different disconnected empty nodes, it can never be taken. (If it only had one inner airspace, the opponent could eventually surround and then fill it to capture the network. If there is two, however, the suicide rule prevents them from filling either inner empty space.) Detecting moves that make figure-8 type shapes, or split an encircled empty node chain into two smaller ones, are very strong.

In addition, if the opponent has only a single such move, playing there first to block it is often extremely disruptive, and can even lead to their network being captured.
