# Hacknet nodes

This distributed network of computers allows you to gain money passively.
By upgrading a node's stats you can increase the amount of money it earns.
If the cost gets too high, it is also possile to purchase brand new nodes.

Hacknet nodes won't make as much money as scripts, but they can be useful at the start.

There is a very powerful upgrade to them called [Hacknet Servers](../advanced/hacknetservers.md)
