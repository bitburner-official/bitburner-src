# Hacknet nodes

This distributed network of computers allows you to gain passive income.
By upgrading a node's stats you can increase the amount of money it earns.
It is also possible to purchase new nodes - each node price increases as your network grows.

Hacknet nodes won't make as much money as decent hacking scripts, and are not enough to progress alone.

Later in the game, there is a very powerful change to the Hacknet system called [Hacknet Servers](../advanced/hacknetservers.md).
