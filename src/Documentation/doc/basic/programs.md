## Programs

In Bitburner "Programs" refer specifically to the list of `.exe` files found in the Programs tab of the side menu.

Unlike `.js` [scripts](scripts.md) you write for yourself with JavaScript, Programs are supplied to you by Bitburner and are only "programs" in name; they do not require or allow you to access actual lines of code. Instead once you have a Program you will be able to use it directly as a function in the [Terminal](terminal.md) or scripts.

    [n00dles /]>  run BruteSSH.exe
    [n00dles /]>  scan-analyze 10

or

    ns.sqlinject("n00dles")

After meeting the [Hacking Skill level](stats.md) threshold shown on each Program, you have the option to Create Program, allowing you to do that as a focused or unfocused activity. The time needed to create a Program generally increases with their level requirement, and scales with your [stats](stats.md).

Alternatively, you may also find the same Programs available for purchase by connecting to the in-game `Darkweb`, accessed after finding a tech store in a City and purchasing Tor [("The Onion Router")](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_(network)>).
