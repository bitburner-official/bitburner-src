# Before you start -

It is highly recommended that you have a basic familiarity with programming concepts like [`for`/`while` loops](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for), [conditionals like `if`/`else`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/if...else), [`functions`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions),[`arrays`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter) and [`variables`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/const) before starting to write scripts - but you can start with basic skills and learn with practice.

If you'd like to first learn a bit about programming, see [this page](../programming/learn.md).

# Scripts

Scripts you write in Bitburner are real, working JavaScript and can be used to automate basic hacking logic, and almost any mechanic in the game.

Running any script requires in-game [RAM](ram.md), with a minimum cost of 1.6 GB per script.
More complex scripts and API functions generally require more [RAM](ram.md), which you will gain in many ways.
Scripts can be run on any [server](server.md) you have root access to, but not all servers you find will have useable RAM.

## How Scripts work offline

Being actual JavaScript, Bitburner also contains some quirks and limitations.
For this reason, it is not possible for Bitburner scripts to run the same way at all times.
However, you will continue to earn money and exp when Bitburner is not running, though at a slower rate.
See [How Scripts Work Offline](../advanced/offlineandbonustime.md) for more details.

## Identifying a Script

Many commands and functions target other scripts running on the same or a different server.
Therefore, there must be a way to specify which script you want to affect.

One way to identify a script is by its unique PID (Process IDentifier).
A PID number is returned from `ns.run()`, `ns.exec()`, etc; and is also shown in the output of `ns.ps()`.

A second way to identify scripts is by filename, hostname **and** arguments.
However, you will probably run multiple copies of a script with the same arguments, so this method is not necessarily **unique** to a script.
In case of multiple matches, most functions will return an arbitrary one (typically the oldest).

If searching by filename, arguments must be an **exact** match - both the order and [type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/typeof) of the arguments you supply matter.

## Referencing Other Scripts

In order to reference a file, `functions` require the **full** absolute file path.
For example

    ns.run("/scripts/hacking/helpers.myHelperScripts.js");
    ns.rm("/logs/myHackingLogs.txt");
    ns.rm("thisIsAFileInTheRootDirectory.txt");

A full file path **must** begin with a forward slash (/) if that file is not in the root directory.
For details on references in terminal commands, see [Terminal](terminal.md).

## Script Arguments

When running a script, you can use [flags](https://github.com/bitburner-official/bitburner-src/blob/bec737a25307be29c7efef147fc31effca65eedc/markdown/bitburner.ns.flags.md) and [arguments](https://github.com/bitburner-official/bitburner-src/blob/bec737a25307be29c7efef147fc31effca65eedc/markdown/bitburner.ns.args.md), which the script's logic can access and act on, allowing flexibility in your script designs. For example allowing you to get different results or attack different targets without re-writing your code:

    $ run hack.js "harakiri-sushi"
    $ run hack.js "silver-helix"

## Multithreading scripts

A script can be run with multiple threads, which we call "multithreading."
Multithreading affects every call to the `ns.hack()`, `ns.grow()`, and `ns.weaken()` methods, multiplying their effects by the number of threads used.
For example, if a script run with 1 thread is able to hack \$10,000, then running the same script with 5 threads would hack $50,000.

[Note -- Scripts will not actually become multithreaded in the real-world sense - Javascript is a "single-threaded" coding language.]

When "multithreading" a script, the total [RAM](ram.md) cost can be calculated by simply multiplying the [RAM](ram.md) cost of a single instance of your script by the number of threads you will use. [See [`ns.getScriptRam()`](https://github.com/bitburner-official/bitburner-src/blob/bec737a25307be29c7efef147fc31effca65eedc/markdown/bitburner.ns.getscriptram.md) or the `mem` terminal command detailed below]

## Working with Scripts in Terminal

Here are some [terminal](terminal.md) commands you will find useful when working with scripts:

**check [script] [args...]**

Prints the logs of the script specified by the name and arguments to [Terminal](terminal.md).
Remember that scripts are uniquely identified by their arguments as well as their name, and
Arguments should be separated by a space.
For example, if you ran a script `foo.js` with the argument `foodnstuff` then in order to 'check' it you must also add `foodnstuff` as an argument for the `check` command:

    $ check foo.js foodnstuff

**free**

Shows the current server's [RAM](ram.md) usage and availability

**kill [pid]** or **kill [script] [args...]**

Stops a script that is running with the specified PID, or script name and arguments.
Remember that scripts are identified by their arguments as well as their name, and
Arguments should be separated by a space.
For example, if you ran a script `foo.js` with the arguments `1` and `2`, then just typing `kill foo.js` will not work.
Instead use:

    $ kill foo.js 1 2

**mem [script] [-t] [n]**

Check how much [RAM](ram.md) a script requires to run with "n" threads

    $ mem [scriptname] -t n
    $ mem hack.js -t 500

**nano [script]**

Create/Edit a script.
The name of a script must end with `.js`, but you can also create `.txt` files.

**ps**

Displays all scripts that are actively running on the current [server](servers.md)

**rm [script]**

Permanently delete a script from the [server](servers.md). Can only be undone with a save import.

**run [script] [-t] [n] [args...]**

Run a script with n threads and the specified arguments.
Each argument should be separated by a space.
Both the thread count and arguments are optional.
If neither are specified, then the script will be run with a single thread and no arguments.

Examples:

Run `foo.js` single-threaded with no arguments::

    $ run foo.js

Run `foo.js` with 10 threads and no arguments:

    $ run foo.js -t 10

Run `foo.js` single-threaded with three arguments: `[foodnstuff, sigma-cosmetics, 10]`:

    $ run foo.js foodnstuff sigma-cosmetics 10

Run `foo.js` with 50 threads and a single argument: `foodnstuff`:

    $ run foo.js -t 50 foodnstuff

**tail [pid]** or **tail [script] [args...]**

Displays the logs of the script specified by the PID or filename and arguments.
Remember that scripts are identified by their arguments as well as their filename.
For example, if you ran a script `foo.js` with the argument `foodnstuff`, in order to `tail` it you must also add the `foodnstuff` argument to the `tail` command as so:

    $ tail foo.js foodnstuff

**top**

Prints all scripts running on the server and their [RAM](ram.md) usage.

    $ top
