# Infiltration

Infiltration is a gameplay mechanic that allows you to infiltrate a [Company](companies.md)'s facility to try and steal the [Company](companies.md)'s classified secrets.
These secrets can be sold for money or for [Reputation](reputation.md) with a [Faction](factions.md).

## Overview

Many companies have facilities that you can attempt to infiltrate.
By infiltrating, you can steal classified [Company](companies.md) secrets and then sell these for money or for [Faction](factions.md) [Reputation](reputation.md).
To try and infiltrate a [Company](companies.md), visit a [Company](companies.md) through the [World](world.md) menu.
There will be an option that says 'Infiltrate [Company](companies.md)'.

When infiltrating a [Company](companies.md), you will be presented with short active challenges.
None of the challenges use the mouse.

The difficulty at the top lowers with better combat stats and charisma.
It is not recommended to attempt infiltrations above mid-normal.

The `maximum level` is the number of challenges you will need to pass to receive the infiltration reward.

Every time you fail an infiltration challenge, you will take damage based on the difficulty of the infiltration.
If you are reduced to `0` hp or below, the infiltration will immediately end.
