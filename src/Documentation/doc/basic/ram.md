# RAM

In Bitburner, RAM determines how many [Scripts](scripts.md) can run on a [Server](servers.md).

Multiplying the number of threads a [Script](scripts.md) uses multiplies its RAM cost, but also multiplies the effectiveness of several functions such as `ns.hack()`, `ns.grow()`, and `ns.weaken()`.

You can purchase more RAM for your home computer from tech vendors.
You can also use other computers as source of additional RAM.
