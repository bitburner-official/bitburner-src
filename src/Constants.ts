  LatestUpdate: `
  v2.1.0 - 2022-09-23 Remote File API
  -----------------------------------
  
    Dev notes
    * The most important change about this update is the introduction of the remote file api.
      With this we also deprecate the HTTP file api and the visual studio extension. Those things
      were made during the rush of Steam and aren't well thought out. This new process works with
      both the web and Steam version of the game and every text editor. Moving forward we also
      won't be doing much, if any, upgrades to the in-game editor. We think it's good enough for
      now and if you need more we recommend you hook up your favorite external editor.
    * Added functions to resize, move, and close tail windows
    * Added a new Augmentation, Z.O.Ã‹., which allows Sleeves to benefit from Stanek.
