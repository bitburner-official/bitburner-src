  LatestUpdate: `
v2.3 Dev

General:
* Monaco script editor updated to a newer version + more config options. (@Snarling)
* Revamp of script ram calculation process, should be more reliable now. (@Snarling)
* Improve ns.scp filename recognition when leading slash discrepancy (@lucebac)
* Fix memory leak when netscript ports were initialized and never used again. (@Snarling)
* Fix a bug that could result in an infinite atExit loop if a script killed itself. (@Snarling)
* Fix a bug where numeric terminal arguments were not being detected as strings when enclosed in quote marks. (@LiamGeorge1999)
* Fix a bug with hackAnalyzeThreads where infinite threads would be indicated any time a single thread would hack less than $1 (@Snarling)
* All Math Expressions contract no longer accepts wrong answers (@Snarling)
* Improve Electron's handling of external links (@Snarling) 
* Documentation improvements (@Mughur, @quacksouls, @Snarling, @AdityaHegde)
* Performance improvements for shallow typechecking on objects sent into API (e.g. for formulas) (@Snarling)
* Faction invites now trigger immediately when backdooring a server.

SF2:
* Corrected the "Next equipment unlock" text for member upgrades. (@LiamGeorge1999)

SF4:
* Faction invites trigger immediately when running ns.singularity.getFactionInvitations (@Snarling)

SF6:
* Failing a contract or operation now consumes the action (@Zelow79)

SF9:
* The SF9.3 bonus is also given to the player when inside of BN9. (@Zelow79)
* Adjusted the SF1 bonus for hacknet costs (slight nerf), and raised the SF9 bonus to compensate. (@d0sboots)

SF10:
* Sleeve shock recovery now scales with intelligence. (@Tyasuh)
* Sleeve kills during crimes count towards numPeopleKilled (@Zelow79)
* Fix a misspelled moneySourceTracker call for sleeves (@zerbosh)
* ns.sleeve.getTask return value now includes cyclesNeeded where applicable (@Snarling)
* Internal type refactoring on Sleeve Work. (@Snarling)

SF13:
* Improve performance of Stanek's gift update cycle, and rework (buff) bonus time handling. (@Snarling)

Misc:
* Nerf noodle bar

2.2.2 Hotfixes
* Fix an issue that prevented the Electron API server from communicating with the VSCode plugin. (credit to u/AnyGiraffe4367 on reddit)

Planned changes remaining in 2.3:
* 2.3 will include a large planned rework to corporation. This may cause api breaks for any corporation scripts, and there will be large changes in how the corporation mechanic functions.
* Enum changes, potentially causing API break with some enums. Enums will be more usable and there will be more of them.
* Constants rework - interenal game constants will be reorganized and will be provided to the player as different categories of constants.
* Further deprecation of ns1. Removal of more documentation, add ingame notice to prompt player to update scripts to .js.
* Nerf noodle bar
