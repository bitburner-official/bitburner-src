## Lore (HIGHLY WIP):
Player found BN with a spreading virus. The intruder seems to have great control over the simulation. Analysing the virus showed that emulating a similar version of the worm grants significant bonuses.

Phrasing / idea not final. May (likely) be scrapped.

## Mechanic:

The "worm" is a x number long series of numbers in the range of [0, 1] (or [-1, 1] ?).
The player can guess a series they provide and get a value of how close the guess is.
The player can set their guess to a provided series and get bonuses according to the similarity of the guess and the actual series.
Every x amounts of time, the worm slightly changes.
The player can specify multiple difficulties. This changes how fast and how much the worm changes and how many formulas make up the worm.
This allows for the player to either guess manually with slow and small changes to the worm,
while allowing the player to use advanced algorithms for higher bonuses.

## Difficulties:
The difficulties can change these aspects:
 - rate of change (both speed and amount)
 - number of formulas making up the worm
 - (length of worm)

Possible difficulties:
 - Manual mode
	Very weak bonuses
	Long window between changes
	Tiny changes to the worm
	Intended to allow the player to guess manually
 - Normal mode
  Average bonuses
	Normal window between changes
	Tiny changes to the worm
	Other difficulties are based on this difficulty
 - Fast mode
  Strong bonuses
	Fast changes to the worm
	Big changes to the worm
	Intended to be used with scripts


## UI:
Requirements:
- Description and explanation of the Mechanic
- Feedback on the fitness (similarity) of the guess
- Manual input field

Ideas for visuals:
- The fitness of the worm could be a simple progress bar (more is better)
- (It could also be a snake walking on a hamiltonian cycle (faster is better))

## API:
- "testGuess", which doesn't set the worm and only gives a fitness value
 (like 1 if it's the exact series and 0 if it is completely off)
- "setGuess", which sets the guess to be used.
- "setDifficulty", which sets the difficulty to be used.
- "setBonus", which sets the bonus to be used.

## Bonuses:
- Stanek charge increase:
 Increases the charges acquired per thread by some percentage

- Hacking time multiplier:
 Don't know how to phrase this:
 Weaken-time is 4x Hack-time and Grow-time is 3.2x Hack-time (or something like that)
 This decreases the time difference by some percentage
 Like 4x -> 2x, 3.2x -> 1.6x (highly exaggerated)
