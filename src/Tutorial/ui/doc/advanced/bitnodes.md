# BitNodes

A BitNode is an important part of the game's storyline. In the game, you discover
what BitNodes are by following the trail of clues left by the mysterious `jump3r`.

## What is a BitNode

A BitNode is the complex simulated reality in which you reside. By following the messages
from `jump3r`, you discover that humanity was enslaved by an advanced alien race, called
the Enders, using virtual simulations that trapped the minds of humans.

However, the Enders didn't just create a single virtual reality to enslave humans, but many
different simulations. In other words, there are many different BitNodes that exist.
These BitNode are very different from each other.

jump3r tells you that the only hope for humanity is to destroy all of these BitNodes.
Therefore, the end goal for the player is to enter and then destroy each BitNode.

Destroying a BitNode resets most of the player's progress but grants the player a
powerful second-tier persistent upgrade called a [Source-File](sourcefiles.md).
Different BitNodes grant different [Source-Files](sourcefiles.md).

Each BitNode has unique characteristics that are related to varying backstories. For example, in one BitNode the world is in the middle of a financial catastrophe with a collapsing market. In another BitNode, most forms of income such as working at a [Company](../basic/companies.md) or [Hacknet Nodes](../basic/hacknet_nodes.md) are significantly less profitable. [Servers](../basic/servers.md) have less money on them and lowered growth rates, but it is easier to lower their security level using the `weaken` function.

Furthermore, some BitNodes introduce new content and mechanics. For example there is one
BitNode that grants access to the [Singularity API](https://github.com/bitburner-official/bitburner-src/blob/dev/markdown/bitburner.singularity.md).
There is another BitNode in which you can manage a [Gang](gang.md) to earn money and [Reputation](../basic/reputation.md).

## How to destroy a BitNode

Initially, the only way to destroy a BitNode is to join Daedalus.
From Daedalus, the player can obtain an [Augmentation](../basic/augmentations.md) called `The Red Pill`, which doesn't cost any money but does require a good amount of [Faction](../basic/factions.md) [Reputation](../basic/reputation.md).

After installing `The Red Pill`, the player must search for and then manually `hack` a
server called `w0r1d_d43m0n`. This server requires a hacking level of `3000`, sometimes more, in order to successfully hack it. This will destroy the player's current BitNode.

There is a second method of destroying a BitNode, but it must be unlocked by first
destroying BitNode-6 or BitNode-7 ([Bladeburners](bladeburners.md)).

When the player destroys a BitNode, most of their progress will be reset. This includes things such as [Augmentations](../basic/augmentations.md) and [RAM](../basic/ram.md) upgrades on the home computer. The only things that will persist through destroying BitNodes is:

- [Source-Files](sourcefiles.md)
- [Scripts](../basic/scripts.md) on the home computer
- [Intelligence](intelligence.md)
