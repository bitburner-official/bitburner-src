# Crimes

Committing crimes is an active gameplay mechanic that allows the player to train
their stats and potentially earn money. The player can attempt to commit crimes
by visiting `The Slums` through the `City` tab (Alt + w).
`The Slums` is available in every city.

## Basic Mechanics

When you visit `The Slums` you will see a list of buttons that show all of the
available crimes. Simply select one of the options to begin attempting that
crime. Attempting to commit a crime takes a certain amount of time. This time
varies between crimes.

While doing crimes, you can click “Do something else simultaneously”
to be able to do things while you continue to do crimes in the background. There is a
20% penalty to the related gains. Clicking the “Focus” button under the overview
will return you to the current task.

Crimes are not always successful. Your rate of success is determined by your
stats (and Augmentation multipliers) and can be seen on the crime-selection
page. If you are unsuccessful at committing a crime you will gain EXP,
but you will not earn money. If you are successful at committing the crime
you will gain extra EXP (4x of what an unsuccessful attempt would give)
and earn money.

Harder crimes are typically more profitable, and also give more EXP.
