# Factions

Throughout the game you may receive invitations from factions. There are
many different factions, and each faction has different criteria for
determining its potential members. Joining a faction and furthering
its cause is crucial to progressing in the game and unlocking endgame
content.

It is possible to join multiple factions if you receive invitations from
them. However, note that joining a faction may prevent you from joining
other rival factions. (Don't worry, this usually isn't the case. Also,
it would only be temporary since resetting the game by installing
[Augmentations](augmentations.md) will clear all your factions)

The `Factions` link on the menu brings up a list of all factions that
you have joined. You can select a Faction on this list to go to that
Faction page. This page displays general information about the Faction
and also lets you perform work for the faction. Working for a Faction
is similar to working for a [Company](companies.md) except that you don't get paid a
salary. You will only earn reputation in your Faction and train your
[Stats](stats.md).

Earning reputation for a Faction unlocks powerful [Augmentations](augmentations.md).
Purchasing and installing these [Augmentations](augmentations.md) will upgrade your
abilities. The [Augmentations](augmentations.md) that are available to unlock vary
from Faction to Faction.
