# Source-Files

Source-Files are a type of persistent upgrade that is more powerful than Augmentations.
Source-Files are received by destroying a Bitnode. There are many different BitNodes
in the game and each BitNode will grant a different Source-File when it is destroyed.

A Source-File can be upgraded by destroying its corresponding BitNode a second or
third time (playing through that BitNode again). It can be upgraded to a maximum
of level 3, with the exception of source-file 12, which has no hard limit.
