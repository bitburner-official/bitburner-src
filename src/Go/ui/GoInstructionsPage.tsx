        <br />
        <Typography>
          In late 2070, the .org bubble burst, and most of the newly-implemented IPvGO 'net collapsed overnight. Since
          then, various factions have been fighting over small subnets to control their computational power. These
          subnets are very valuable in the right hands, if you can wrest them from their current owners.
        </Typography>
        <br />
        <br />
        <Grid container columns={2}>
          <Grid item className={classes.instructionsBlurb}>
            <Typography variant="h5">How to take over IPvGO Subnets</Typography>
            <br />
            <Typography>
              Your goal is to control more <i>empty nodes</i> in the subnet than the faction currently holding it, by
              surrounding those open nodes with your routers.
              <br />
              <br />
              Each turn you place a router in an empty node (or pass). The router will connect to your adjacent routers,
              forming networks. A network's remaining open ports are indicated by lines heading out towards the empty
              nodes adjacent to the network.
              <br />
              <br />
              If a group of routers no longer is connected to any empty nodes, they will experience intense packet loss
              and be removed from the subnet. Make sure you ALWAYS have access to several empty nodes in each of your
              networks! A network with only one remaining open port will start to fade in and out, because it is at risk
              of being destroyed.
              <br />
              <br />
              You also can use your routers to limit your opponent's access to empty nodes as much as possible. Cut a
              network off from any empty nodes, and their entire group of routers will be removed!

            <Typography>
              The game ends when all of the open nodes on the subnet are completely surrounded by a single color, or
              when both players pass consecutively.
              <br />
              <br />
              Once the subnet is fully claimed, each player will get one point for each empty node they fully surround
              on the subnet, plus a point for each router they have. You can use the edge of the board along with your
              routers to fully surround and claim empty nodes. <br />
              <br />
              White will also get a few points (called "komi") as a home-field advantage in the subnet, and to balance
              black's advantage of having the first move.
              <br />
              <br />
              Any territory you control at the end of the game will award you stat multiplier bonuses. Winning the node
              will increase the amount gained, but is not required.
              <br />
              <br />
              Win streaks against a faction will give you +1 favor to that faction at certain numbers of wins (up to a
              max of {getMaxFavor()} favor), if you are currently a member of that faction.

            <br />
            <Typography>
              * Because these subnets have fallen into disrepair, they are not always perfectly square. Dead areas, such
              as the top-left corner in the example above, are not part of the subnet. They do not count as territory,
              and do not provide open ports to adjacent routers.
              <br />
              <br />
              * You cannot suicide your own routers by cutting off access to their last remaining open node. You also
              cannot suicide a router by placing it in a node that is completely surrounded by your opponent's routers.
              <br />
              <br />
              * There is one exception to the suicide rule: You can place a router on ANY node if it would capture any
              of the opponent's routers.
              <br />
              <br />
              * You cannot repeat previous board states. This rule prevents infinite loops of capturing and
              re-capturing. This means that in some cases you cannot immediately capture an enemy network that is
              flashing and vulnerable.
              <br />
              <br />
              Note that you CAN re-capture eventually, but you must play somewhere else on the board first, to make the
              overall board state different.

            <Typography>

              <br />
              <br />
              * If a network surrounds a single empty node, the opponent can eventually capture it by filling in that
              node. However, if your network has two separate empty nodes inside of it, the suicide rule prevents the
              opponent from filling up either of them. This means your network cannot be captured! Try to build your
              networks to surround several different empty nodes, and avoid filling in your network's empty nodes when
              possible.
              <br />
              <br />
              * Pay attention to when a network of routers has only one or two open ports to empty spaces! That is your
              opportunity to defend your network, or capture the opposing faction's.
              <br />
              <br />
              * Every faction has a different style, and different weaknesses. Try to identify what they are good and
              bad at doing.
              <br />
              <br />
              * The best way to learn strategies is to experiment and find out what works!
